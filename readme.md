## Purpose of this project
This project was made to learn how to develop a very basic back-end app with Firebase. I learnt how to connect a Firebase database with vanilla Javascript.

## Tutorial

## What is Realtime Database from Firebase?
Firebase is a free service by Google that provides an online database with a library to add, query, modify and remove data from the database. The data are stored online in a json file.

## Files
At the difference with the tutorial, I took the freedom to divide my html, css and js into 3 different files. The code is hence more readable and easier to understand.
